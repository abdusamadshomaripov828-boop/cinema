      <h1>BLACK WIDOW</h1>

      <p>
        After the events at the Leipzig-Halle airport, Natasha was overtaken
        by the mistakes of the past. The Red Room again made itself felt – a
        program to create Widows – professional killers and spies – just like
        her. Natasha decides once and for all to deal with people whose efforts
        she herself became a Widow.
